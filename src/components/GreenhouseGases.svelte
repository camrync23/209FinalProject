    <p>Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are gases in the Earth's atmosphere that trap heat, creating a "greenhouse effect" that warms the planet. These gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O), naturally occur in the atmosphere but have increased dramatically due to human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial farming. As these gases build up, they prevent some of the heat from escaping into space, leading to a gradual rise in global temperatures.</p>
